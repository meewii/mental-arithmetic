# Mental Arithmetic #

Mental Arithmetic is an app to exercice your brain with simple or evil math operations. Choose your level and your favorite operations and GO!. The app will remember what you failed at and make you pay for it.

## Story ##

Mental Arithmetic was born when a friend - let's call him Bob - needed a simple app to train his brain with maths (because he's lousy). I needed a small project to learn how to make an application with **Kotlin** so I decided to combine the two.

## Requirements from Bob ##

- "Can I choose between addition, multiplication, subtraction and division?"
- "Can I see all submitted answers in list? even if it's wrong... actually, if its wrong, can it be red?"
- "That'll be great if I could set the minimal and maximal values instead of having levels of difficulty"
- "Is there a way for the app to make me retry the formulas I failed?"
